			<h4> President (Channelside and Core)</h4>

			Joshua Oliver <br>
			<p>Email: 40011010@student.furness.ac.uk</p>
			<p>My name is Joshua Olliver and I am on my third year of studying hairdressing. I love to read books and study languages. My current goals are to make student life better and more engaging. I want to focus on student mental health, wellbeing, and helping make Furness college more diverse and environmentally friendly.</p>
			<p>My Role as president is to oversee the students' Union. I attend meetings with senior members of the college which helps me to get the students' voice heard.</p>

			Matthew Lamb <br>

			<p>I am the Communication Officer for the Student Union I developed the FCSU website, and I manage the FCSUâ€™s social media platforms. I also interact with the marketing department to promote the Student Union.</p>
			<p>During my time as Communication Officer, I want to make communication easier by making contact emails of the Student Officers easily accessible for students and further digitalising the Student Union.</p>

			<h4> Vice President (Rating Lane)</h4>
			
			<div id=aboutus>
			Varenka T Briggs <br>
			<p>Email:40019228@student.furness.ac.uk</p>
			<p>I am Varenka T Briggs and I am a student at Barrow Sixth Form College Rating Lane. I took the role of Vice President as I wanted to be a voice for people with disabilties and inspire them to realise that they can achieve whatever they want to achieve. I want to encourage people that their disability, be it mental or physical is not the deciding factor in how successful they will be in life and that a disabiltiy is something that should be viewed positively in society.</p>
			<p>I study A-level Law, English Language and History. Outside of college I am working towards achieving my grade 8 singing exam. I sing for venues for example in the Pandemic I sang for Abbey View nursing home. I really enjoy spending time playing netball with a few students from college. Being Vice President for me ment I have the opportunity to set up a social group and a small studios group in college in order to help students and create somewhere people can voice their opinions and grow in confidence. This is a role I feel passionately about and I hope in reading this I have inspired you.</p>

			<h4> LGBT Officer</h4>
			
			<div id=aboutus>
			Shanel-Regan Austin <br>
			<p>Email: 40020608@student.furness.ac.uk</p>
			<p>I am Shanel-Regan Austin, I am a student at Furness College Channelside. I took the role of LQBTQ+ officer so I could encourage students to be themselves and not to be scared of any judgment. I am currently on the level 2 hairdressing course and outside of college I attend two local dance schools one being Instep School of Dance and the other being Cumbria Cascades. As LGBTQ+ officer I am looking at starting a club where people of the community can come to make friends or to have a place to talk to someone if they feel like they are being judged for who they are.</p>
